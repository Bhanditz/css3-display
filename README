CSS Display Module Level 3
==========================

This is a proposal (not officially endorsed by the CSS Working Group) for a new spec for the 'display' property in CSS.

This proposal adds some new values to the 'display' property, and turns it into a shorthand for 'display-inside' and 'display-outside' properties.
